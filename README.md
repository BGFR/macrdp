# macrdp

A native RDP server for macOS, written in Rust on top of [IronRDP]. Connect from `mstsc`, Microsoft Remote Desktop, or FreeRDP to drive your Mac desktop with keyboard, mouse, real-cursor-shape forwarding, and text clipboard sync. Authenticates against your local Mac account via PAM.

This is the macOS equivalent of `xrdp`. Not a client, not a VNC bridge.

## Status

v0 — daily-driver usable on a trusted LAN. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for what's wired up, what isn't, and known quirks.

## Quick start

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/macrdp
```

First run will prompt for:
1. **Screen Recording permission** (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → enable `macrdp` → restart it).
2. **Accessibility permission** (same path, "Accessibility" — required to forward keyboard and mouse).
3. Your Mac password at the terminal — validated against your local account via PAM `checkpw`, then used as the RDP credential.

Then connect from a client to `<your-mac-ip>:3390` with your Mac username and password. From Windows `mstsc`: expand **Show Options**, put your username in the **User name** field *before* clicking Connect (otherwise mstsc sends an empty username over plain-SSL fallback).

## CLI

```
--bind 0.0.0.0:3390       Listen address (3390 by default; 3389 needs root)
--username NAME           Defaults to $USER
--password PASS           Skip the interactive prompt
--skip-auth               Bypass PAM (testing only)
--width / --height        Override autodetected display size
--fps N                   Frame rate cap (default 15)
--cert-dir PATH           Persisted TLS cert (default ~/Library/Application Support/macrdp)
```
